# TravelAgency
:sun_with_face:  Travel Agency

This application is designed to manage the activity inside a travel agency. Using this application, travel agencies can track information about their business requirements.
1.	There are several tourism agencies in the database.
2.	The agents who work for a specific agency help the customers to choose from the available offers.
3.	Customers can book offers based on their requirements.
4.	An offer contains information about accommodation and transportation for the desired destination.
5.	Customers can buy multiple offers with different agents' help.
6.	Customers can view information about what type of accommodation(hotel, hostel, etc.), time for check-in and check-out, price, and location.
7.	Customers can view information about what type of transport(plane, car, train, etc.), arrival and departure time, price, and destination.
8.	Customers provide personal information( first name, last name, email, birth date) relevant to make a reservation.
9.	Information about a travel agency's address, name, and email is stored in the database.
10.	An agent works only for one agency. He has a first name, last name, email, phone number, and salary.
11.	The administrator can view all offers a specific travel agency makes available.
Â 
The functionality of the application is demonstrated using Postman. I created a Postman collection of API for each endpoint. This collection is exported as JSON.
